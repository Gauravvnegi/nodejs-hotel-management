Created routes for a hotel management system involves defining endpoints for different functionalities such as managing waiters, managers, chefs, and menus. Additionally, using MongoDB to store the records allows for efficient storage and retrieval of hotel details. Here's a basic structure for your Node.js project along with instructions for setting up and running it:
